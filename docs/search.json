    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\n\nWorking From Home Patterns\nOverall, 67% of respondents were WFH at least sometimes during the pandemic, and 45% were mainly WFH. Working from home varied by demographic characteristics:\n\nAge: Young adults (20-29 years) were mainly WFH less often (19%) compared to 30-49 years (51%) and 50-67 years (47%)\nSex: No clear differences between males (45%) and females (46%)\nEducation: Highly educated participants WFH more frequently (54%) than those with low education (19%)\n\n\n\nWorkload\nAmong those who were mainly WFH, a smaller proportion reported a decrease in workload (12-16%) compared to those who never WFH. Females reported a higher increase in workload than males regardless of whether they were WFH:\n\nFemales mainly WFH: 41% reported increase vs. 13% decrease\nMales mainly WFH: 29% reported increase vs. 15% decrease\n\nAmong those aged 20-29 who were mainly WFH, 37% reported increased workload compared to 34% among those aged 50-67.\n\n\nSupport, Cooperation, and Participation\nA larger proportion of participants who were WFH at least sometimes reported a decrease rather than an increase in:\n\nSupport when needed: Among those mainly WFH, 14-19% reported decrease vs. 9-15% increase\nCooperation at the workplace: Among those mainly WFH, 20-28% reported decrease vs. 13-18% increase\n\nParticipation at the workplace: Among those mainly WFH, 19-26% reported decrease vs. 10-17% increase\n\nThe youngest age group (20-29 years) showed more polarized responses, reporting both higher increases and decreases in these factors compared to older age groups.\n\n\nInfluence and Control Over Work\nReported influence and control over one’s own work increased more than it decreased among those who were WFH at least sometimes. The increase was highest among 20-29 year olds:\n\nAge 20-29, mainly WFH: 24% reported increase vs. 9% decrease\nAge 50-67, mainly WFH: 13% reported increase vs. 7% decrease\n\nNo clear differences were found by sex or educational level for those who were WFH.\n\n\nWork-Life Balance\nAmong those who were mainly WFH, a larger proportion reported an increase (12-32%) than a decrease (11-15%) in their possibility to combine work and private life. The increase was most pronounced in the 30-49 age group (32%) compared to 20-29 years (18%) and 50-67 years (22%).\n\n\nStructuring the Workday\nJust over half (52%) of participants who were WFH reported difficulties structuring the workday, though only 8% found it difficult most of the time. Difficulty structuring the day varied by age:\n\nAge 20-29: 32% reported no difficulty\nAge 30-49: 42% reported no difficulty\n\nAge 50-67: 55% reported no difficulty"

    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\nThe results revealed both positive and negative aspects of WFH during the pandemic. Participants who were WFH reported greater control over work and private life while also reporting decreased cooperation, participation, and support when needed.\n\nSex Differences\nWorkload was reported to have increased for a substantially larger proportion of women than men regardless of whether they were WFH. Among those who were never WFH, a larger proportion of women than men also reported decreased: possibility to combine work and private life, support when needed, participation at the workplace, and influence and control over one’s own work. These patterns may relate to sex differences in sectors (such as healthcare) and experiences of stress and overtime work.\n\n\nAge Differences\nFor those who were WFH, cooperation, participation, and support were more frequently reported to have decreased than increased. The youngest age group (20-29) reported both more increases and more decreases in these factors compared to older groups, highlighting how WFH recommendations impacted this age group more substantially. This polarized experience may relate to living circumstances, as young adults are more likely to live with parents or share housing with others.\n\n\nOpportunities and Challenges\nThe results showed that WFH provided opportunities to structure one’s life, with many participants reporting increased influence and control over their work—particularly younger people. However, structuring the workday at home was reported as difficult by a larger proportion of participants younger than 30 years compared to older counterparts. The lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues may contribute to feelings of social isolation, which has been identified as one of the major negative effects of WFH.\n\n\nStudy Limitations\nSeveral limitations should be considered:\nCross-sectional design: We cannot determine if increases in work-related factors are directly related to WFH or other societal changes during the pandemic. Approximately 13% of participants changed workplaces during the study period, potentially affecting results.\nSelf-reported data: Some participants may have over-reported WFH compliance if it was viewed as socially desirable to follow recommendations.\nResponse bias: Response rates were lower for males and younger age groups. Previous analysis of the PART study found that non-response was related to low income, low education, and previous psychiatric diagnosis. While this may affect representativeness, it is unlikely to substantially affect associations between WFH and work conditions.\nGeneralizability: Sweden handled the pandemic differently than other European countries, with relatively few restrictions and only temporary school closings. However, since work environments are expected to be similar to other European contexts, results on the effects of WFH may be generalizable."

    "text": "Conclusions\nThis population-based study of 4,985 Stockholm workers found that working from home during the pandemic was associated with increased control over work and improved work-life balance, while simultaneously being associated with decreased cooperation, participation, and workplace support. Women reported substantially greater workload increases than men, and young adults reported the most polarized changes—both the highest benefits and the steepest challenges. As remote and hybrid work arrangements persist beyond the pandemic, these findings highlight the need for organizations to actively address the social and collaborative dimensions of work that may be undermined when teams are distributed."

    "text": "Discussion\nOur study showed a significant increasing trend in LD cases in the EU/EEA during 2017-2019 compared with the previous five years. The distribution of cases per week suggested an overall amplification of seasonal trends, with summer peaks in 2017-2019 growing higher than the 2012-2016 range.\n\nSensitivity Analysis\nIn November 2014, Portugal experienced an outbreak contributing 291 cases. To assess whether this influenced our findings, we repeated the analysis excluding these cases. The results showed a 35.4% excess (compared to 33.9% with the outbreak included), with differences mainly in late 2019. This confirmed that our main findings were not driven by the 2014 outbreak.\n\n\nPotential Contributing Factors\nWhile this study established that the trend changed, it did not aim to identify causal factors. However, several factors may have contributed to the observed increase:\nDemographic changes: Europe’s population aged 65+ increased by 3.0 percentage points as a share of total population between 2010-2020. Since older individuals are at higher risk for LD, demographic aging may contribute to rising case numbers.\nClimate patterns: Studies have found associations between LD incidence and weather conditions such as warmer temperatures, higher humidity, and increased rainfall. The years 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2019 were among Europe’s warmest years on record by the end of 2019.\nBuilding water systems: Risk factors for Legionella growth in engineered water systems include system design, water temperature, and biofilm accumulation. Changes in building practices or maintenance could influence disease risk.\nTourism patterns: Tourism statistics showed a continuous increase in nights spent in tourist accommodation establishments by both domestic and international guests during 2012-2019, though imported cases did not show a significant trend increase in our analysis.\nThese potential contributing factors warrant further investigation to better understand the determinants of the observed increase.\n\n\nStudy Limitations\nThe analysis excluded five countries due to incomplete data, representing 13.4% of initially available cases. However, the percentage of excluded cases remained stable across years (10.9%-14.3%), suggesting minimal impact on trend assessment."

I’m a data analyst and demographer at Sweden’s Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (TLV), where I work on health economics analysis, GIS tools for pharmacy accessibility planning, and risk assessment models. My recent analysis of dental market pricing was featured in a ministerial broadcast and helped shape government subsidy reforms launching in January 2026. I hold a Master’s in Demography from Stockholm University, and have worked at Swedish government agencies, European health institutions including ECDC and Karolinska Institute, and the United Nations. I work primarily in R, Python, and SQL, with current interests in Bayesian methods and health economics.\nBeyond data analysis, I’m deeply curious about how different societies organize themselves. I’ve travelled extensively across Europe, Asia, and beyond, seeking to understand demographic patterns, healthcare systems, and diverse communities—an interest that continually informs my analytical work."

    "text": "The Approach: Optimization Meets Geography\nWe approached this as a classic Maximum Coverage Location Problem: given a fixed number of emergency pharmacies, where should they be placed to maximize population coverage? The methodology combined geographic data, demographic analysis, and optimization algorithms to find the answer.\n\nBuilding the Data Foundation\nThe analysis started with comprehensive open data sources. Statistics Sweden provided population distribution data with the country divided into 1km² grid squares—essential for understanding where people actually live. We had precise coordinates for all ~1,400 existing pharmacies nationwide, which served as potential emergency pharmacy locations. OpenStreetMap provided road network data for calculating realistic travel distances, accounting for Sweden’s varied terrain from dense urban areas to remote northern regions.\n\n\nThe Optimization Strategy\nFor each scenario we tested (ranging from 50 to 700 pharmacies), we needed to determine optimal placement. The approach balanced geographic equity with population efficiency: every county was guaranteed at least one pharmacy to prevent any region from being completely unserved, then remaining pharmacies were distributed proportionally based on population. Within each county, we identified locations that maximized coverage within a 10km radius.\nFor each configuration we calculated both straight-line distances (as the crow flies) and actual driving distances using road networks. A location 8km away in straight-line distance might be 15km by winding mountain roads in northern Sweden. We created isochrones (areas reachable within specific distances) using the OpenRouteService API to understand true accessibility under realistic travel conditions.\n\n\nFinding the Inflection Point\nRather than selecting an arbitrary target, we ran the optimization across multiple scenarios and let the data reveal where adding more pharmacies stopped meaningfully improving coverage. The approach involved analyzing every 50-pharmacy increment from 50 to 700 to identify the point of diminishing returns where each additional pharmacy provided less and less marginal benefit."

Below 300 pharmacies, coverage dropped precipitously—at just 100 pharmacies, only 45% of the population would be within 10km driving distance of pharmaceutical services. This would leave millions of Swedes vulnerable during a crisis.\nAt 300 pharmacies, something important happened: 90% of Sweden’s population came within 20km driving distance—a threshold we identified as reasonable accessibility even under crisis conditions where people might need to travel further than normal. Going from 300 to 500 pharmacies only added 4 percentage points of coverage despite requiring 67% more facilities. The marginal benefit curve flattened dramatically beyond this point, indicating we had found the optimal balance between coverage and resource efficiency."

Each threshold represented a different accessibility standard: 5km for urban convenience, 10km as reasonable for routine access (which we used as the optimization radius), 20km as maximum acceptable for rural areas, and 50km which captured nearly all of Sweden’s population even with minimal pharmacy coverage.\nThe 20km threshold became the critical policy metric. At 300 pharmacies, achieving 90% coverage within 20km represented a balanced target—stringent enough to ensure genuine accessibility even under crisis conditions, but realistic given Sweden’s geography and sparse northern population.\n\n\nCounty-Level Optimization\nWe optimized county-by-county rather than nationwide simultaneously—a pragmatic simplification driven by computational constraints. A true global optimum might place pharmacies differently across county boundaries, but our approach offered important benefits: proportional allocation balanced population needs, each county received guaranteed minimum service preventing complete regional gaps, and the results could be validated against external tools.\n\n\nValidation and Confidence\nWhen we compared our results with Tillväxtverket’s independent accessibility calculations using different methodology, the numbers matched within 2-3 percentage points. This external validation confirmed that despite simplifications, the approach was producing reliable estimates suitable for policy decisions."

This pragmatic approach allowed us to complete the analysis within project timelines while still producing reliable results.\nExternal validation matters: Comparing our findings with Tillväxtverket’s independent calculations provided crucial confidence that the methodology was sound. In policy work, external confirmation transforms analysis from “interesting” to “actionable.”\nClear communication: The challenge wasn’t just running the optimization—it was translating technical findings about isochrones, MCLP algorithms, and marginal coverage curves into language that policymakers and ministers could understand and act upon. The visualizations and clear threshold findings (90% coverage at 300 pharmacies) made the results immediately graspable."

    "text": "Background & Challenge\n\nThe Problem\nSweden’s dental care system faced a fundamental resource allocation challenge. While healthy patients were visiting dentists more frequently than clinically recommended, high-risk patients who truly needed preventive care were not receiving adequate attention. This inefficiency stemmed from manual risk assessment processes that varied significantly across regions, leading to inconsistent care prioritization. The proposed solution of manual dentist assessments at every appointment would require an additional 10-25 minutes per visit, imposing a staggering cost of 1.2-3.1 billion SEK annually—representing 6-16% of total adult dental care spending. Furthermore, a trust-based system without automated controls created vulnerabilities to welfare fraud and over-treatment.\n\n\nProject Goals\nOur project aimed to explore whether these challenges could be addressed through an AI-driven approach. We set out to develop an automated, objective risk assessment system that could process 3 million annual assessments at scale while achieving high accuracy in predicting tooth loss and periodontitis. Critically, any solution would need to meet regulatory requirements for explainability, ensuring that patients could understand the factors driving their risk assessments. This proof-of-concept would determine whether such a system was technically feasible and could inform future development efforts by TLV."

The figure below illustrates the model’s discriminative performance:\n\n\n\nROC Curve for Periodontitis Prediction\n\n\n\n\nClinical Interpretation\nThe model’s performance translates to meaningful clinical utility. When correctly identifying 75% of patients who will develop periodontitis, it simultaneously incorrectly classifies only 25% of healthy patients as high-risk. More remarkably, the model can differentiate between high and low-risk patients with exceptional precision: patients in the highest risk group are 171 times more likely to develop periodontitis than those in the lowest risk group.\n\n\nCalibration\nBeyond discriminative accuracy, we found that the models demonstrated excellent calibration. For tooth loss predictions, the predicted risks closely matched observed outcomes across all risk levels. For periodontitis, we observed near-perfect calibration up to the 95th percentile of risk scores, as shown in the figure below:\n\n\n\nCalibration Curve for Periodontitis Prediction\n\n\nThis calibration performance means the model’s probability estimates are reliable: if it predicts a patient has 20% risk, approximately 20% of such patients will actually experience that outcome. This reliability is crucial for clinical decision-making and patient communication."

    "text": "Technical Innovations\n\n1. Handling Imbalanced Data\nOne of the project’s key challenges was working with highly imbalanced outcomes—only 2-6% of patients experienced the conditions we were trying to predict. We addressed this through several strategies: adjusting the loss function to give higher weight to the minority class, maintaining outcome distribution across train/test splits through stratified sampling, and using appropriate metrics like ROC AUC and precision-recall curves rather than simple accuracy measures.\n\n\n2. Feature Engineering\nWe created a comprehensive set of risk indicators across multiple dimensions. These included binary indicators for the presence or absence of specific treatments, count variables capturing treatment frequency, time-based features distinguishing the COVID period from normal operations, geographic clustering using 9 county types and 3 municipality types, and interaction effects between demographics and treatment history. This multi-dimensional approach allowed the model to capture complex patterns in patient risk profiles.\n\n\n3. Explainability Framework\nMeeting regulatory requirements under Swedish Administrative Law §32 was non-negotiable for any future implementation. We developed a marginal effects framework that could translate model predictions into patient-friendly explanations:\nFor each patient:\n1. Calculate risk score (0-100)\n2. Identify top risk factors driving the score\n3. Express deviations from population average in standardized terms:\n   - \"Slightly higher\" (0-1 std dev)\n   - \"Higher\" (1-2 std dev)\n   - \"Much higher\" (2-3 std dev)\n   - \"Extremely higher\" (&gt;3 std dev)\n4. Generate natural language explanation\nExample output: &gt; “You were assigned to the high-risk group because your risk score was 80/100. Your risk score indicates higher risk than the average patient. An important explanation was that you received one root canal during the pandemic, which is much higher than the average patient. Another important explanation was…”"

By leveraging Sweden’s comprehensive dental care data and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, our team created a system that:\n\nAchieves high predictive accuracy (84% ROC AUC for periodontitis)\nCould operate efficiently at scale (3 million assessments annually)\nMeets regulatory requirements for explainability\nCould deliver substantial economic benefits (1-3 billion SEK savings)\nWould improve patient outcomes through early risk identification\n\nMost importantly, we successfully established that AI-driven risk assessment for dental care is both technically feasible and clinically valuable. This foundational work has enabled the Swedish government to task TLV with developing an enhanced production model for future implementation in Sweden’s national dental care subsidy system. While the full deployment remains several years away, this project represents a crucial first step toward what could become one of the first large-scale deployments of AI for healthcare resource allocation in the Nordic countries."

The automated approach could potentially avoid 1.2-3.1 billion SEK annually in manual assessment costs while providing instant risk calculations instead of 10-25 minute manual assessments at each appointment. Automated controls could reduce welfare fraud risk, and the system would ensure uniform risk assessment across all regions, eliminating the current geographic variation in care prioritization.\n\n\nPotential Benefits for Patients\nFor individual patients, such a system could enable better health outcomes through early identification and preventive care for high-risk individuals. More efficient resource allocation could reduce unnecessary visits and associated costs, while transparent, clear explanations for subsidy decisions would help patients understand their care recommendations. Critically, the system would apply the same assessment criteria regardless of location or provider, ensuring equitable access to preventive care.\n\n\nLong-term Population Health Impact\nPerhaps most importantly, our model demonstrates how AI could enable a fundamental shift from reactive to preventive dental care. By identifying high-risk patients before serious conditions develop and concentrating resources where they provide the most benefit, such a system could contribute to reducing the prevalence of advanced periodontal disease while generating long-term cost savings through prevention rather than treatment."

The production model will need to integrate seamlessly with clinical workflows while preserving dentists’ ability to apply professional expertise where appropriate.\nExplainability is Non-Negotiable: Legal requirements for decision transparency under Swedish Administrative Law §32 shaped our technical approach from the start. The explainability framework we developed demonstrates one approach, but the production system will likely require even more sophisticated patient communication tools.\nScale Changes Everything: Our proof-of-concept worked with historical data, but a production system processing 3 million live assessments annually will face different challenges around data quality, real-time processing, and system integration with existing healthcare IT infrastructure.\nContinuous Monitoring and Updating: A production model will require ongoing performance monitoring and periodic retraining as dental care practices and patient populations evolve over time.\nThe timeline for implementing TLV’s enhanced model remains uncertain, with full deployment likely several years away.

    "text": "Key Findings\nOverall, 67% of respondents worked from home at least sometimes during the pandemic, with 45% working from home mainly. WFH was more common among highly educated workers (54%) compared to those with low education (19%), and less common among young adults aged 20-29 (19%) compared to older age groups (47-51%).\n\nBoth positive and negative aspects of working from home\nThose working from home reported both improvements and declines in different aspects of work. Those working from home reported increased control over their work and improved work-life balance, but also reported decreased cooperation, participation, and workplace support. This pattern held across demographic groups, suggesting an association between remote work and complex trade-offs.\n\n\nPronounced Gender Differences\nWomen reported substantially higher increases in workload than men, regardless of whether they were working from home. Among those mainly WFH, 41% of women reported increased workload compared to 29% of men. This gender gap persisted even among those who never worked from home, where women also reported greater decreases in workplace support, participation, and control over work—patterns that may reflect sex differences in sectors like healthcare and experiences of stress.\n\n\nAge-Related Polarization\nYoung adults (20-29 years) reported the most polarized changes. When working from home, they reported both the highest increases and highest decreases in cooperation, participation, and support compared to older workers. They also reported more difficulty structuring their workday at home (only 32% reported no difficulty, compared to 55% of those aged 50-67). However, younger workers who were WFH also reported the largest increases in control over work (24% increase vs. 13% among those aged 50-67), highlighting the particularly pronounced associations between remote work and work changes in this age group—both positive and negative."

    "text": "Implications and Limitations\nThese findings reveal associations between remote work and both positive and negative changes in work conditions that varied significantly by demographics. The pattern of decreased cooperation and workplace support among those working remotely alongside increased autonomy and work-life balance points to important trade-offs. The pronounced gender gap in workload increases suggests that among women—particularly those in sectors like healthcare—remote work was not associated with reduced workload and may be linked to existing sectoral inequalities.\nThe study has several limitations worth noting. The cross-sectional design prevents us from definitively attributing changes to WFH versus other pandemic-related factors. Self-reported data may include social desirability bias, particularly around WFH compliance. Response rates were lower among males and younger adults, though this is unlikely to substantially affect the observed associations between WFH and work conditions. Finally, Sweden’s relatively light-touch pandemic response (few restrictions, temporary school closures) may limit generalizability, though work environments are likely similar to other European contexts."
