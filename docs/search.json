    "text": "Background & Challenge\n\nThe Problem\nSweden’s dental care system faced a fundamental resource allocation challenge. While healthy patients were visiting dentists more frequently than clinically recommended, high-risk patients who truly needed preventive care were not receiving adequate attention. This inefficiency stemmed from manual risk assessment processes that varied significantly across regions, leading to inconsistent care prioritization. The proposed solution of manual dentist assessments at every appointment would require an additional 10-25 minutes per visit, imposing a staggering cost of 1.2-3.1 billion SEK annually—representing 6-16% of total adult dental care spending. Furthermore, a trust-based system without automated controls created vulnerabilities to welfare fraud and over-treatment.\n\n\nProject Goals\nOur project aimed to explore whether these challenges could be addressed through an AI-driven approach. We set out to develop an automated, objective risk assessment system that could process 3 million annual assessments at scale while achieving high accuracy in predicting tooth loss and periodontitis. Critically, any solution would need to meet regulatory requirements for explainability, ensuring that patients could understand the factors driving their risk assessments. This proof-of-concept would determine whether such a system was technically feasible and could inform future development efforts by TLV."

    "text": "Approach & Methodology\n\nData Infrastructure\nWe leveraged Sweden’s unique advantage: comprehensive structured data from the national dental care subsidy system since 2008. This rich dataset included over 150 million dental visits with detailed procedure codes for every treatment, patient demographics and health indicators, and geographic and socioeconomic factors. For our analysis, we used 61,050 patients in the training dataset (spanning January 2016 to August 2022) and 15,057 patients in the test dataset (January 2017 to August 2023), with up to 1,892 risk indicators engineered for each patient.\n\n\nModel Development\nWe developed and compared three prediction models to assess whether increasing model complexity would yield meaningful improvements in predictive accuracy:\n\n1. Baseline Age Model\n\nSimple logistic regression using only age (≥67 vs &lt;67)\nServed as benchmark for comparison\nROC AUC: 55-58%\n\n\n\n2. Logistic Regression with Treatment History\n\nIncorporated comprehensive risk indicators:\n\nTreatment frequency and types\nNumber of remaining/intact teeth\nCOVID-19 period adjustments\nDemographics and geographic factors\n\nROC AUC: 71-80%\n\n\n\n3. Deep Learning Neural Network\n\nSequential neural network with 1-3 hidden layers\nBuilt using TensorFlow/Keras with automated hyperparameter tuning\nArchitecture optimized for handling:\n\nImbalanced outcomes (2-6% positive cases)\nHigh-dimensional input (1,892 features)\nComplex non-linear relationships\n\n\nTechnical specifications:\n# Model architecture (example configuration)\n- Input layer: 1,892 features (normalized)\n- Hidden layers: 1-3 layers with ReLU activation\n  - Layer 1: 50-75% of input size\n  - Layer 2: 10-40% of input size  \n  - Layer 3: 5-10% of input size\n- Output layer: Sigmoid activation for binary classification\n- Regularization: L2 penalty (0.001-0.005)\n- Optimization: Adam optimizer (learning rate: 1-4%)\n- Loss function: Binary cross-entropy with class weighting\n\n\n\nHyperparameter Optimization\nTo ensure optimal model performance, we implemented systematic hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner. This process tested 20 variants per model with 3 repetitions each to reduce random variation, training over 12 epochs. In total, we computed 2,520 models over 2.5 days of processing time, selecting the final models based on validation set performance.\n\n\nOutcome Variables\nWe focused on predicting three key dental health outcomes:\n\nTooth loss: Root canal treatment or extraction (6% of patients)\nPeriodontitis: Extensive periodontal treatment (2% of patients)\nCombined outcome: Either condition (8% of patients)"

The figure below illustrates the model’s discriminative performance:\n\n\n\nROC Curve for Periodontitis Prediction\n\n\n\n\nClinical Interpretation\nThe model’s performance translates to meaningful clinical utility. When correctly identifying 75% of patients who will develop periodontitis, it simultaneously incorrectly classifies only 25% of healthy patients as high-risk. More remarkably, the model can differentiate between high and low-risk patients with exceptional precision: patients in the highest risk group are 171 times more likely to develop periodontitis than those in the lowest risk group.\n\n\nCalibration\nBeyond discriminative accuracy, we found that the models demonstrated excellent calibration. For tooth loss predictions, the predicted risks closely matched observed outcomes across all risk levels. For periodontitis, we observed near-perfect calibration up to the 95th percentile of risk scores, as shown in the figure below:\n\n\n\nCalibration Curve for Periodontitis Prediction\n\n\nThis calibration performance means the model’s probability estimates are reliable: if it predicts a patient has 20% risk, approximately 20% of such patients will actually experience that outcome. This reliability is crucial for clinical decision-making and patient communication."

    "text": "Technical Innovations\n\n1. Handling Imbalanced Data\nOne of the project’s key challenges was working with highly imbalanced outcomes—only 2-6% of patients experienced the conditions we were trying to predict. We addressed this through several strategies: adjusting the loss function to give higher weight to the minority class, maintaining outcome distribution across train/test splits through stratified sampling, and using appropriate metrics like ROC AUC and precision-recall curves rather than simple accuracy measures.\n\n\n2. Feature Engineering\nWe created a comprehensive set of risk indicators across multiple dimensions. These included binary indicators for the presence or absence of specific treatments, count variables capturing treatment frequency, time-based features distinguishing the COVID period from normal operations, geographic clustering using 9 county types and 3 municipality types, and interaction effects between demographics and treatment history. This multi-dimensional approach allowed the model to capture complex patterns in patient risk profiles.\n\n\n3. Explainability Framework\nMeeting regulatory requirements under Swedish Administrative Law §32 was non-negotiable for any future implementation. We developed a marginal effects framework that could translate model predictions into patient-friendly explanations:\nFor each patient:\n1. Calculate risk score (0-100)\n2. Identify top risk factors driving the score\n3. Express deviations from population average in standardized terms:\n   - \"Slightly higher\" (0-1 std dev)\n   - \"Higher\" (1-2 std dev)\n   - \"Much higher\" (2-3 std dev)\n   - \"Extremely higher\" (&gt;3 std dev)\n4. Generate natural language explanation\nExample output: &gt; “You were assigned to the high-risk group because your risk score was 80/100. Your risk score indicates higher risk than the average patient. An important explanation was that you received one root canal during the pandemic, which is much higher than the average patient. Another important explanation was…”"

While the model itself is not yet implemented, our findings provide a foundation for TLV’s future development work and illustrate the potential benefits such a system could deliver.\n\nPotential Benefits for the Healthcare System\nAn implemented AI-based risk assessment system could deliver substantial value. The automated approach could potentially avoid 1.2-3.1 billion SEK annually in manual assessment costs while providing instant risk calculations instead of 10-25 minute manual assessments at each appointment. Automated controls could reduce welfare fraud risk, and the system would ensure uniform risk assessment across all regions, eliminating the current geographic variation in care prioritization.\n\n\nPotential Benefits for Patients\nFor individual patients, such a system could enable better health outcomes through early identification and preventive care for high-risk individuals. More efficient resource allocation could reduce unnecessary visits and associated costs, while transparent, clear explanations for subsidy decisions would help patients understand their care recommendations. Critically, the system would apply the same assessment criteria regardless of location or provider, ensuring equitable access to preventive care.\n\n\nLong-term Population Health Impact\nPerhaps most importantly, our model demonstrates how AI could enable a fundamental shift from reactive to preventive dental care. By identifying high-risk patients before serious conditions develop and concentrating resources where they provide the most benefit, such a system could contribute to reducing the prevalence of advanced periodontal disease while generating long-term cost savings through prevention rather than treatment."

This next phase of development, expected to take several years, will build upon our methodological foundation while addressing additional requirements for a production system.\n\nKey Lessons for Future Development\nOur work revealed several critical insights that will inform TLV’s future development efforts:\nAutomation and Trust: Balancing automated efficiency with healthcare professionals’ clinical judgment requires careful system design. The production model will need to integrate seamlessly with clinical workflows while preserving dentists’ ability to apply professional expertise where appropriate.\nExplainability is Non-Negotiable: Legal requirements for decision transparency under Swedish Administrative Law §32 shaped our technical approach from the start. The explainability framework we developed demonstrates one approach, but the production system will likely require even more sophisticated patient communication tools.\nScale Changes Everything: Our proof-of-concept worked with historical data, but a production system processing 3 million live assessments annually will face different challenges around data quality, real-time processing, and system integration with existing healthcare IT infrastructure.\nContinuous Monitoring and Updating: A production model will require ongoing performance monitoring and periodic retraining as dental care practices and patient populations evolve over time.\nThe timeline for implementing TLV’s enhanced model remains uncertain, with full deployment likely several years away.

    "text": "The Approach: Optimization Meets Geography\nWe approached this as a classic Maximum Coverage Location Problem: given a fixed number of emergency pharmacies, where should they be placed to maximize population coverage? The methodology combined geographic data, demographic analysis, and optimization algorithms to find the answer.\n\nBuilding the Data Foundation\nThe analysis started with comprehensive open data sources. Statistics Sweden provided population distribution data with the country divided into 1km² grid squares—essential for understanding where people actually live. We had precise coordinates for all ~1,400 existing pharmacies nationwide, which served as potential emergency pharmacy locations. OpenStreetMap provided road network data for calculating realistic travel distances, accounting for Sweden’s varied terrain from dense urban areas to remote northern regions.\n\n\nThe Optimization Strategy\nFor each scenario we tested (ranging from 50 to 700 pharmacies), we needed to determine optimal placement. The approach balanced geographic equity with population efficiency: every county was guaranteed at least one pharmacy to prevent any region from being completely unserved, then remaining pharmacies were distributed proportionally based on population. Within each county, we identified locations that maximized coverage within a 10km radius.\nFor each configuration we calculated both straight-line distances (as the crow flies) and actual driving distances using road networks. A location 8km away in straight-line distance might be 15km by winding mountain roads in northern Sweden. We created isochrones (areas reachable within specific distances) using the OpenRouteService API to understand true accessibility under realistic travel conditions.\n\n\nFinding the Inflection Point\nRather than selecting an arbitrary target, we ran the optimization across multiple scenarios and let the data reveal where adding more pharmacies stopped meaningfully improving coverage. The approach involved analyzing every 50-pharmacy increment from 50 to 700 to identify the point of diminishing returns where each additional pharmacy provided less and less marginal benefit."

At just 100 pharmacies, only 45% of the population would be within 10km driving distance of pharmaceutical services. This would leave millions of Swedes vulnerable during a crisis.\nAt 300 pharmacies 90% of Sweden’s population came within 20km driving distance. This threshold was identified as reasonable accessibility under crisis conditions where people might need to travel further than normal. Going from 300 to 500 pharmacies only added 4 percentage points of coverage despite requiring 67% more facilities.

    "text": "From Analysis to Policy\nOur analysis was published in TLV’s 2023 report “Stärkt förmåga på apoteksmarknaden” (Strengthened Capacity in the Pharmacy Market), documenting the full methodology and findings. The 300 threshold subsequently appeared in proposed pharmacy legislation as the target number for state-run emergency pharmacies (riksapotek). The analysis was presented in nationwide ministerial broadcasts as Sweden grappled with its changing security environment, and it now guides operational decisions about emergency pharmacy placement in the evolving system.\nWhat made this particularly meaningful was seeing rigorous geographic data analysis directly inform national security planning. In a time of geopolitical uncertainty, evidence-based approaches to critical infrastructure resilience became more important than ever. The 300-pharmacy system represents a practical, cost-effective approach to ensuring Swedes maintain access to essential medications even in crisis scenarios that once seemed unthinkable."

We presented this proof-of-concept to the government, demonstrating how a risk assessment model for dental health can be developed.

    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\nOur study showed a significant increasing trend in LD cases in the EU/EEA during 2017-2019 compared with the previous five years. The distribution of cases per week suggested an overall amplification of seasonal trends, with summer peaks in 2017-2019 growing higher than the 2012-2016 range.\n\nSensitivity Analysis\nIn November 2014, Portugal experienced an outbreak contributing 291 cases. To assess whether this influenced our findings, we repeated the analysis excluding these cases. The results showed a 35.4% excess (compared to 33.9% with the outbreak included), with differences mainly in late 2019. This confirmed that our main findings were not driven by the 2014 outbreak.\n\n\nPotential Contributing Factors\nWhile this study established that the trend changed, it did not aim to identify causal factors. However, several factors may have contributed to the observed increase:\nDemographic changes: Europe’s population aged 65+ increased by 3.0 percentage points as a share of total population between 2010-2020. Since older individuals are at higher risk for LD, demographic aging may contribute to rising case numbers.\nClimate patterns: Studies have found associations between LD incidence and weather conditions such as warmer temperatures, higher humidity, and increased rainfall. The years 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2019 were among Europe’s warmest years on record by the end of 2019.\nBuilding water systems: Risk factors for Legionella growth in engineered water systems include system design, water temperature, and biofilm accumulation. Changes in building practices or maintenance could influence disease risk.\nTourism patterns: Tourism statistics showed a continuous increase in nights spent in tourist accommodation establishments by both domestic and international guests during 2012-2019, though imported cases did not show a significant trend increase in our analysis.\nThese potential contributing factors warrant further investigation to better understand the determinants of the observed increase.\n\n\nStudy Limitations\nThe analysis excluded five countries due to incomplete data, representing 13.4% of initially available cases. However, the percentage of excluded cases remained stable across years (10.9%-14.3%), suggesting minimal impact on trend assessment."

    "text": "Key Findings\nOverall, 67% of respondents worked from home at least sometimes during the pandemic, with 45% working from home mainly. WFH was more common among highly educated workers (54%) compared to those with low education (19%), and less common among young adults aged 20-29 (19%) compared to older age groups (47-51%).\n\nBoth positive and negative aspects of working from home\nThose working from home reported both improvements and declines in different aspects of work. Those working from home reported increased control over their work and improved work-life balance, but also reported decreased cooperation, participation, and workplace support. This pattern held across demographic groups, suggesting an association between remote work and complex trade-offs.\n\n\nPronounced Gender Differences\nWomen reported substantially higher increases in workload than men, regardless of whether they were working from home. Among those mainly WFH, 41% of women reported increased workload compared to 29% of men. This gender gap persisted even among those who never worked from home, where women also reported greater decreases in workplace support, participation, and control over work—patterns that may reflect sex differences in sectors like healthcare and experiences of stress.\n\n\nAge-Related Polarization\nYoung adults (20-29 years) reported the most polarized changes. When working from home, they reported both the highest increases and highest decreases in cooperation, participation, and support compared to older workers. They also reported more difficulty structuring their workday at home (only 32% reported no difficulty, compared to 55% of those aged 50-67). However, younger workers who were WFH also reported the largest increases in control over work (24% increase vs. 13% among those aged 50-67), highlighting the particularly pronounced associations between remote work and work changes in this age group—both positive and negative."

    "section": "Implications and Limitations",
    "text": "Implications and Limitations\nThese findings reveal associations between remote work and both positive and negative changes in work conditions that varied significantly by demographics. The pattern of decreased cooperation and workplace support among those working remotely alongside increased autonomy and work-life balance points to important trade-offs. The pronounced gender gap in workload increases suggests that among women—particularly those in sectors like healthcare—remote work was not associated with reduced workload and may be linked to existing sectoral inequalities.\nThe study has several limitations worth noting. The cross-sectional design prevents us from definitively attributing changes to WFH versus other pandemic-related factors. Self-reported data may include social desirability bias, particularly around WFH compliance. Response rates were lower among males and younger adults, though this is unlikely to substantially affect the observed associations between WFH and work conditions. Finally, Sweden’s relatively light-touch pandemic response (few restrictions, temporary school closures) may limit generalizability, though work environments are likely similar to other European contexts."

Some serve small populations with many nearby alternatives, while others are the sole lifeline for thousands of people across vast rural areas. Understanding which pharmacies are most critical helps inform policy decisions about emergency pharmacy designation, resource allocation, and crisis planning."

    "text": "The Approach: Measuring Vulnerability\nThe vulnerability analysis identifies critical pharmacies by asking a simple question for each one: What would happen if this pharmacy closed? Specifically, it calculates how much extra distance people would need to travel to reach their next-nearest alternative.\n\nThe Methodology\nThe analysis works through several steps:\n\nDistance Calculation: For every populated grid square in Sweden (1km² resolution), calculate the Haversine distance to all pharmacies in the country. This creates a comprehensive distance matrix covering millions of population-pharmacy combinations.\nNearest Pharmacy Assignment: For each grid square, identify both the nearest pharmacy and the second-nearest pharmacy. This tells us where people currently go and where they would need to go if their primary pharmacy closed.\nImpact Calculation: Calculate the “extra distance” people would need to travel—the difference between their nearest and second-nearest pharmacy. A grid square 3km from its nearest pharmacy but 15km from the next closest faces a 12km extra distance burden if the nearest one closes.\nCriticality Scoring: For each pharmacy, sum up the total population-weighted extra distance across all the grid squares that rely on it. This “person-km impact” score represents the total additional distance burden on the population if that specific pharmacy were to close.\n\n\n\n[PLACEHOLDER: Map showing pharmacy locations color-coded by criticality score]"

The most critical pharmacies have person-km impact scores in the hundreds of thousands or even millions, while less critical ones may have scores in the thousands or hundreds.\n\n[PLACEHOLDER: Distribution plot showing person-km impact scores across all pharmacies]\nThe most critical pharmacies typically share certain characteristics:\n\nGeographic Isolation: Located in areas where the next-nearest pharmacy is far away\nLarge Catchment Areas: Serving populations spread across wide geographic regions\nRural Locations: Often in sparsely populated areas where travel distances are inherently larger\nUnique Coverage: Being the only pharmacy within a reasonable distance for their catchment area\n\nConversely, pharmacies in dense urban areas like Stockholm, Gothenburg, or Malmö tend to have lower criticality scores. While they may serve many people, those populations have numerous nearby alternatives within walking distance.\n\n\n[PLACEHOLDER: Bar chart showing top 20 most critical pharmacies by municipality]"

    "text": "Why This Matters for Policy\nThis vulnerability analysis has direct applications for emergency preparedness and healthcare infrastructure planning:\nEmergency Pharmacy Designation: When selecting which 300 pharmacies should become state-run emergency pharmacies (riksapotek), criticality scores help ensure the most vulnerable populations are prioritized. A pharmacy in a remote northern municipality serving thousands with no nearby alternative should be prioritized over one in central Stockholm with ten competitors within 1km.\nResource Allocation: During crises when resources are limited, knowing which pharmacies are most critical helps direct supplies, staff, and support where they’ll have the greatest population impact.\nClosure Impact Assessment: When commercial pharmacies close (as happens regularly in Sweden’s competitive market), this analysis helps policymakers understand the public health implications and whether intervention is warranted.\nInfrastructure Planning: The analysis identifies geographic gaps in pharmaceutical coverage that might need addressing through new pharmacy establishment or mobile pharmacy services.\n\n[PLACEHOLDER: Map showing geographic coverage gaps - areas with high vulnerability]"

A facility might serve fewer people but be far more critical if those people have no good alternatives."
