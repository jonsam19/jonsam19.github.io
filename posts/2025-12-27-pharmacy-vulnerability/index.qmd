## The Question

One way to answer this question is to look at geographical accessibility. While we know Sweden needs approximately 300 strategically-placed pharmacies for emergency preparedness, not all pharmacies are equally important. Some serve small populations with many nearby alternatives, while others are the sole lifeline for thousands of people across vast rural areas. Understanding which pharmacies are most critical helps inform policy decisions about emergency pharmacy designation, resource allocation, and crisis planning.

## The Approach: Measuring Vulnerability

The vulnerability analysis identifies critical pharmacies by asking a simple question for each one: *What would happen if this pharmacy closed?* Specifically, it calculates how much extra distance people would need to travel to reach their next-nearest alternative.

### The Methodology

The analysis works through several steps:

1. **Distance Calculation**: For every populated grid square in Sweden (1km² resolution), calculate the Haversine distance to all pharmacies in the country. This creates a comprehensive distance matrix covering millions of population-pharmacy combinations.

2. **Nearest Pharmacy Assignment**: For each grid square, identify both the nearest pharmacy and the second-nearest pharmacy. This tells us where people currently go and where they would need to go if their primary pharmacy closed.

3. **Impact Calculation**: Calculate the "extra distance" people would need to travel—the difference between their nearest and second-nearest pharmacy. A grid square 3km from its nearest pharmacy but 15km from the next closest faces a 12km extra distance burden if the nearest one closes.

4. **Criticality Scoring**: For each pharmacy, sum up the total population-weighted extra distance across all the grid squares that rely on it. This "person-km impact" score represents the total additional distance burden on the population if that specific pharmacy were to close.

## The Results: Not All Pharmacies Are Equal

The analysis reveals dramatic variation in pharmacy importance across Sweden. The most critical pharmacies have person-km impact scores in the hundreds of thousands or even millions, while less critical ones may have scores in the thousands or hundreds.

### **[PLACEHOLDER: Distribution plot showing person-km impact scores across all pharmacies]**

The most critical pharmacies typically share certain characteristics:

- **Geographic Isolation**: Located in areas where the next-nearest pharmacy is far away
- **Large Catchment Areas**: Serving populations spread across wide geographic regions
- **Rural Locations**: Often in sparsely populated areas where travel distances are inherently larger
- **Unique Coverage**: Being the only pharmacy within a reasonable distance for their catchment area

Conversely, pharmacies in dense urban areas like Stockholm, Gothenburg, or Malmö tend to have lower criticality scores. While they may serve many people, those populations have numerous nearby alternatives within walking distance.

## Why This Matters for Policy

This vulnerability analysis has direct applications for emergency preparedness and healthcare infrastructure planning:

**Emergency Pharmacy Designation**: When selecting which 300 pharmacies should become state-run emergency pharmacies (riksapotek), criticality scores help ensure the most vulnerable populations are prioritized. A pharmacy in a remote northern municipality serving thousands with no nearby alternative should be prioritized over one in central Stockholm with ten competitors within 1km.

**Resource Allocation**: During crises when resources are limited, knowing which pharmacies are most critical helps direct supplies, staff, and support where they'll have the greatest population impact.

**Closure Impact Assessment**: When commercial pharmacies close (as happens regularly in Sweden's competitive market), this analysis helps policymakers understand the public health implications and whether intervention is warranted.

**Infrastructure Planning**: The analysis identifies geographic gaps in pharmaceutical coverage that might need addressing through new pharmacy establishment or mobile pharmacy services.

## The Code and Data

The full vulnerability analysis is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jonsam19/pharmacy_accessibility_sweden/blob/main/scripts/vulnerability_analysis.R). The script calculates criticality scores for all pharmacies in Sweden using open data sources.

The methodology is transparent and reproducible:

- **Data Sources**: Statistics Sweden population grid data, pharmacy locations from Pipos
- **Distance Calculation**: Haversine distances for computational efficiency
- **Scoring System**: Population-weighted extra distance (person-km impact)
- **Output**: Detailed criticality rankings for every pharmacy with supporting statistics

The analysis can be run by anyone with R and the required packages. The script includes comprehensive documentation and validation checks.

## Connections to the Broader Emergency Pharmacy Project

This vulnerability analysis complements the broader emergency pharmacy optimization work by providing a different lens on pharmacy importance. While the [main optimization analysis](../2025-10-31-pharmacy-accessibility/index.html) asks "How many pharmacies do we need and where?", this vulnerability analysis asks "Which existing pharmacies are most critical?"

The two approaches together provide a complete picture:

- **Coverage Optimization**: Identifies the minimum number of pharmacies needed for adequate national coverage and their optimal placement
- **Vulnerability Analysis**: Identifies which existing pharmacies serve the most critical roles based on geographic isolation and population dependence

For emergency preparedness planning, combining both analyses ensures that the 300-pharmacy emergency system is both efficiently distributed (optimization) and prioritizes the most vulnerable populations (criticality).

## Broader Applications

The vulnerability analysis methodology extends beyond pharmacy planning to any distributed service infrastructure:

- **Healthcare Facilities**: Identifying critical hospitals, clinics, or health centers whose closure would severely impact access
- **Emergency Services**: Understanding which fire stations or ambulance stations serve the most isolated populations
- **Public Services**: Prioritizing libraries, post offices, or government service centers in rural areas
- **Education**: Assessing the impact of school closures on student travel distances

The key insight is measuring not just how many people a facility serves, but how much worse off those people would be without it. A facility might serve fewer people but be far more critical if those people have no good alternatives.
